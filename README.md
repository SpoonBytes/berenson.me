# berenson.me
My personal website.

Built with NPM script and deployed with http://surge.sh/.

*Obviously, the build script is a little excessive for the simplicity of the website. This is intended to be a template to build upon in the future, however, and therefore the sacrifice of repository simplicity is worth it... for now.*
